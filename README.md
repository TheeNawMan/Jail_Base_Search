# Jail_Base_Search
Built this when deciding to playing with API's. Was currious if anything existed to search jail records via API's. Found jailbase.com

This code pulls all sources and then iterates through each one to find a last name. If you want to look for a first name I will add that in the future along with other features from the Jailbase API. https://www.jailbase.com/api/
